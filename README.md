📝 Summary

This project focuses on miniaturizing the Da Vinci Robotic Surgery System and enhancing its functionality with additional safety and control features.

Implemented features include:

👤 Face Detection

👁️ Pupil Detection

🎨 Color Detection

⚙️ Color Parameter Adjustment Menu

📐 Area & Center Point Detection of Colored Objects

🔐 Password-Based Safety System

🦾 6-Axis Robotic Arm Control Circuit

A 6-axis robotic arm was used, with a separate camera mounted to capture real-time images.

Color detection, area measurement, and coordinate tracking were performed and displayed to the operator.

Simultaneously, face and pupil detection ensured secure and authorized operation.

If detection failed for a predefined time, the robotic arm control system was automatically disabled for safety.

A password authentication system further restricted access to authorized users only.

Robotic arm control required both correct password entry and active face/pupil detection.
